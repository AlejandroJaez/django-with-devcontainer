# Streamline Your Django Development with VS Code Dev Containers

Developing Django applications in a consistent and reproducible environment can be a challenge, especially when working across different machines or teams. VS Code Dev Containers provide a powerful solution by encapsulating your development environment inside a Docker container, ensuring that every developer works with the same dependencies, tools, and configurations.

In this blog post, we'll walk through setting up a VS Code Dev Container for Django development using a `devcontainer.json` configuration and a `Dockerfile.dev`.

## Why Use VS Code Dev Containers?

With Dev Containers, you can:
- Avoid dependency conflicts by isolating your development environment.
- Standardize your tooling across different machines.
- Easily onboard new team members without the hassle of environment setup.
- Leverage VS Codeâ€™s powerful remote development features.

## Setting Up Your Dev Container

### 1. Creating the `devcontainer.json`

The `devcontainer.json` file is the heart of the VS Code Dev Container configuration. Here's what our configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "Django Development",
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "../Dockerfile.dev"
  },
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker",
        "charliermarsh.ruff"
      ],
      "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/venv/bin/python",
        "python.formatting.provider": "ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Specifies the development container name.
- Uses a Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`) to define the container environment.
- Installs necessary VS Code extensions for Python and Docker support.
- Configures the Python environment and formatting tool (`ruff`).

### 2. Creating the `Dockerfile.dev`

To define our Django development environment, we use the following `Dockerfile.dev`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Set environment variables
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin/:$PATH" \
    VIRTUAL_ENV=/venv \
    UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/venv \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

WORKDIR /app

# Install development dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    ca-certificates \
    git \
    make \
    gcc \
    postgresql-client && \
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh && \
    /root/.local/bin/uv tool install ruff && \
    /root/.local/bin/uv venv /venv && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy dependency files
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./

# Install dependencies including development packages
RUN uv pip install --editable ".[dev]"

# Mount the application code as a volume
VOLUME ["/app"]

# Command to run the development server
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

This Dockerfile:
- Uses Python 3.12 as the base image.
- Sets up a virtual environment (`/venv`).
- Installs necessary system dependencies such as `git`, `gcc`, and `postgresql-client`.
- Uses `uv` to manage dependencies and install `ruff` for code formatting.
- Copies `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for dependency installation.
- Defines a command to run the Django development server.

## Running the Dev Container

To start using the development container:

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Ensure you have the **Dev Containers** extension installed.
3. Click on the **Remote Explorer** in the activity bar and select **Open Folder in Container**.
4. VS Code will build the container and start your development environment.

## Conclusion

Using VS Code Dev Containers simplifies Django development by creating a reproducible, standardized environment. Whether you are working solo or in a team, this approach ensures consistency and ease of setup. Try integrating Dev Containers into your workflow and experience seamless development!
